          <strong>Morgan's Notes:</strong> <br />
          TranStar's been covering their tracks about these. Don't want to look like an arms-tech company.
          They're probably wired into <em>Talos I</em>'s security system. Could track me using the
          station's security rosters. Might be a way to get rid of my tracking bracelet.
